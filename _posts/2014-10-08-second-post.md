I keep testing this because I can. Wow.

I want to add more content. So I post links to some awesome stuff I learned at <a href="frontporch.io">front porch</a>:

<strong>Top three favorite things (because lets be honest, the other stuff was no comprehensible to lil ol me)</strong>
<ul>
	<li><a href="davidscottlyons.com/three.js">This is what happens when coding/art/math meet</a></li>
	<li><a href="showcase.ionicframework.com">Did you know you can make apps for all the phones?</a></li>
	<li><a href="bit.ly/svg-strikes-back">OMG I NEED TO SVG ALL THE THINGS!!</a></li>
</ul>
